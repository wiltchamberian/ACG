# ACG
Automatically code generation, to generate the golang database code, http router, client js based on structure

## user guide
1. First you need to write a .go file which specify the structs.
2. These structs correspond to database table and json.
3. Then run the generator and put this file as the parameter.
4. It will generate the go-lang server codes(including database and routine)based on the parameters.

## future work
1. support generate javascript client code
